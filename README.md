[Photos2Movie](https://video.suveenellawela.com) is an open source non-ai web app that lets you turn your favorite photos into a beautiful video montage in just a few clicks.

## The Story behind

My friends and I hosted a few others to a house party recently. I was playing around with my [PaperShoot Camera](https://papershoot.com) and took a few photos. I thought it would be cool to turn those photos into a video montage. I used iMovie and it took me a good 30-40mins to do that. So I thought, why not build a web app that does that for me in **under a minute**?

The funtionality is really simple and less configurable right now.

This is also inspired by the short videos I've seen where photographers give disposable cameras to strangers and make videos out of the photos they take.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
